    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! <strong>I'm Abdulbaki Suraj</strong> — a software developer with a
      background in mechanical engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
      My journey into the tech world began with backend development using PHP
      and subsequently discovering other languages, tools and frameworks where
      I’ve built a range of functional and curiosity-fueled projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      My curiosity and desire to understand how things run under the hood has
      naturally led me to Cloud Engineering, hence, why I'm here at AltSchool
      :).
    </p>

    <h2>Why I Joined the AltSchool Program</h2>
    <p>
      I joined AltSchool to transition fully into Cloud Engineering. I was drawn
      to the hands-on, structured curriculum and the opportunity to learn
      directly from professionals.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The program offers the kind of community, mentorship, and practical
      exposure I need to bridge the gap between theory and production-grade
      cloud systems. I believe this experience will help me level up and launch
      a meaningful career in any of the cloud niches.
    </p>

    <h2>Goals for the School of Engineering Program</h2>
    <p>
      I still haven't fully grasped the depth of this field, but from what I've
      gathered on the surface level, here are a few goals I'd like to achieve:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Master the core concepts of Cloud Engineering, including networking,
        virtualization, and infrastructure-as-code.
      </li>
      <li>Get hands-on experience with cloud platforms like AWS and Azure.</li>
      <li>
        Build and deploy scalable, secure infrastructure for real-world
        applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        Learn Linux, CI/CD pipelines, containerization (Docker), and
        orchestration (Kubernetes).
      </li>
      <li>Become certified cloud engineer</li>
      <li>
        Finally, land a cloud engineering role after the program (keeping my
        fingers crossed).
      </li>
    </ul>
